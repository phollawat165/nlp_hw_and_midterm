This maybe happen by the fact that unnormalized one only looking for the highest one to make probability product higher which may leading to choosing an \"Eos\" token which will make the sentence end ,but normalized one select the one that make it geometric mean be the highest which maybe avoid selecting an \"Eos\"."
